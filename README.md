# ZipChat
## A way to bypass Minecraft's chat character limit.

ZipChat is a client-side Minecraft mod that enables players to send each other chat messges that would otherwise exceed the length limit. This mod allows messages up to 2x the length normally allowed by Minecraft, or unlimited length for certain types of messages.
