# ZipChat
## A way to bypass Minecraft's chat character limit.
ZipChat is a client-side Minecraft mod that enables players to send each other chat messges that would otherwise exceed the length limit. This mod allows messages up to 2x the length normally allowed by Minecraft, and unlimited length for certain types of messages.

## How does it work?
ZipChat provides a custom chat input window that supports longer messages than the default Minecrfat chat box. If you type or paste a message in this window that is longer than the maximum length, it 'compresses' the message like a zip file so it can fit within the length constraints. For example:


| Message Conversion | Length (characters) | Messaage |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| Plaintext Message | 543 | The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. \[beep\] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. \[ding\] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. |
