## A way to bypass Minecraft's chat character limit.
ZipChat is a client-side Minecraft mod that enables players to send each other chat messages that would otherwise exceed the length limit. This mod allows messages up to 2x the length normally allowed by Minecraft, and unlimited length for certain types of messages.

<br/>

## Supported Minecraft Versions
- 1.12
- 1.12.1
- 1.12.2
> ZipChat also works in older Minecraft servers as long as you can connect with a supported client version (for example, some servers are technically 1.8, but support players using later versions).

<br/>

## How does it work?
ZipChat provides a custom chat input window that supports longer messages than the default Minecrfat chat box. If you type or paste a message in this window that is longer than the maximum length, it 'compresses' the message like a zip file so it can fit within the length constraints, and sends that through chat.
>NOTE: As of Minecraft version 1.11, the maximum chat length is 256 characters. Older versions have a limit of 100 characters. The following tables showcase the types of messages you can send with this mod.

<br/>

### Servers of versions 1.11 and higher - Maximum chat length: 256
| Message Conversion | Length (characters) | Messaage |

| Plaintext Message | 543 | The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. \[beep\] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. \[ding\] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. |

## *Don't worry!*
ZipChat automatically translates any compressed message sent by other players using this mod back into their orignial text, replacing the compressed gibberish in your chat with the original message. This means that any number of players can communicate seamlessly with ZipChat. Other players without the mod see the compressed giberish presented in the examples above, so only players also using ZipChat can recieve your long messages.

>The text turns red when even the compressed message is too long to send. ZipChat will not send this message.

## Controls and Commands

### Default Keybindings

| Key | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| Z | Open ZipChat text input window. |

<br/>

### Commands
> NOTE: These commands only work inside ZipChat's text window.

| Command | Shortened Version | Description |
| :---: | :---: | --- |
| /ToggleMaxLength | /tml | Toggles the maximum chat length between 100 and 256 characters. Use this if ZipChat's maximum length is different than your server's maximum length. If, for instance, ZipChat's max length is 256 and the server's max length is 100, your message might not be sent through chat because it is too long. Just run this command to fix that. |

## *Important Note!*
ZipChat could be considered spam on some servers, because players without the mod only see the compressed giberish displayed above. Make sure to check your server's chat rules before using ZipChat. Use at your own risk!
